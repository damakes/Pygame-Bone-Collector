# Python (OOP) Course Project

Project assignment for Object-Oriented programming course, completed as part of studies during my second year at XAMK UAS, Bachelor of Engineering.

### Bone Collector

The aim of the course project was to develop a simple game, where the player's goal is to collect all the bones on each level, while avoiding dangerous obstacles and advancing to the next level. The game is built using Pygame library, in constructing the game and handling files. It utilizes `pygame.mixer` for sound file management and `pickle` data storage.
